C2PO JavaScript language bindings
=================================

[C2PO](http://keminglabs.com/c2po/) is a grammar of graphics implementation inspired by Hadley Wickham's ggplot2 library.
This JavaScript library uses the free online C2PO compiler and is limited to 1 MB of data.
Plot specifications are compiled directly to an SVG string, which is returned:

```js

```

This is an *experimental* package; the package API, plot specification syntax, and remote server may change or disappear at any time.
